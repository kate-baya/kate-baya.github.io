            <h2>Values and Identity</h2>

            <ul>Core Values:
                <li>Reason</li>
                <li>Autonomy</li>
                <li>Originality</li>
                <li>Skepticism</li>
            </ul>

            <p>According to the Myers & Briggs personality test, I am an INTP (Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving) type. Introversion is a big part of my personality and identity. Intuition is how I process information. Thinking plays a big role in determining my personal values. Perceiving is how I manage my life.</p>
            <p>Introversion: I am energized by spending time on my own and would prefer a Friday night at home watching movies, than at a party or a bar. I enjoy quiet spaces and don’t mind silence in a room even when others are around. I don’t give my time away freely and am very selective with my friends. I prefer a few close friends rather than a large amount of acquaintances.</p>
            <p>Intuition: This how I process information. I am more interested in innovation and creativity than realism and practicality. I enjoy thinking of the future and theorizing what is possible. I value aesthetics over practicality.</p>
            <p>Thinking: Although I like to dream of the future and what is possible, I also believe I am logical and objective in my decision making. I’m not particularly emotional and like to look at things from both sides. Often times I find myself playing devil’s advocate in order to get others to think more objectively. I have noticed that when the decisions directly affect me, I let my emotions have more of a say in my reasoning. I more rational when looking from the outside in and often give advice from this perspective, however if I receive rational advice that goes against what I feel I want, I tend to ignore the advice even though I know it’s the right thing to do. </p>
            <p>Perceiving: I am more interested in going with the flow as opposed to following structure and routine. I do have loose plans that I like to work towards, but I also enjoy the flexibility of being able to decide when and where I carry out those plans. According to my personality test, I am relaxed, spontaneous, impulsive and easy going. </p>

            <h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
            <p>I feel a bit mixed about my culture. My parents both come from Zimbabwe and left the country many years ago when it was still called Rhodesia. The reason they left was due to racial tension. </p>
            <p>I haven’t grown up with the typical New Zealand culture, as my family doesn’t really identify with it (even after all these years). I remember watching the music video for Janet Jackson’s song Together Again when I was young. I thought for sure that the portrayal of Africa with the friendly leopards walking alongside the people was an accurate take on where my “home” should be. We had African decorations all throughout the house and my parents always spoke fondly of their mother country. They always stated they wanted to take me there. Because of this I never considered NZ to be where I was from, although I was born here. </p>
            <p>I always questioned why my parents would leave such a cool place only to come to boring old New Zealand. The older I got, the more their reasoning made sense to me, but I also found it quite conflicting. Once I realized that Africa wasn’t at all how I pictured it, I also realized that I suddenly didn’t belong there and never would. I’ve felt a lack of cultural identity ever since. I think my identity and values have been heavily influenced by this conflict of cultural identity, and I have often cultivated my values through other influences such as my love for music and my religious upbringing.</p>
            <p>My identity and values are always changing, but so far, my religious upbringing has really affected me the most. I was born into a Pentecostal Christian home. I went to church every Sunday (always hated it), and my education was a small private school that was directly associated with the church. I didn’t realise it, but I was very sheltered. The only reason I didn’t turn out Amish was because of my two sisters, one had a child out of wedlock and the other is gay. Although my parents are very loving, they didn’t approve. This only led to more conflict with the ideas I was being taught and what I was actually seeing day to day. I would find myself questioning why certain things were wrong or right. This has led to a healthy sense of reason, autonomy, skepticism and originality.</p>

            <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h2>
            <p>While I was studying during my Bachelor of Music, I was given the opportunity to cheat on a test that I did not feel confident in. We were sitting in a hall all taking the music theory exam for melody. As a drummer, this is not my strong suit. My friend, an accomplished pianist who excelled in melodic music theory, leaned over to me with a copy of their test sheet when the examiner left the room (a rare occurrence). I did give it a thought, but then pushed the sheet away.</p>
            <p>If I had looked at the answers, in my eyes I would have completely devalued my entire degree. I don’t think my desire to learn really affected the decision, but rather it was my independence and need to prove my capability. I had to earn the right to obtain my Bachelor of Music and whether or not I excelled in that particular area was not of concern. I needed to know enough to prove I was worthy. </p>
            <p>Conversely, I also would have been furious if I had copied any answers that were incorrect. Although I believed my friend is competent, I know I can’t trust that they won’t sometimes get something wrong. If I copied my friend and they were wrong I would still be the one to blame, but I would always question whether or not I would have got the answer correct if I just wrote my own answers down. </p>
            <p>For all these reasons I decided not to copy my friend. I took the test on my own and passed. I didn’t get a high mark, but I learnt what I needed to improve on and I surprised myself at what I had correctly answered.</p>
            <p>Although I wasn’t particularly confident, my reasoning, autonomy and self-reliance got me through. </p>

            <h2>My Strengths</h2> 
            <p>Independence: I work well with autonomy, and do not need to have my hand held in order to meet a challenge.</p>
            <p>Analysis: I question everything and take the time to logically consider ideas before accepting them.</p>
            <p>Creativity: I find unconventional solutions to complicated problems.</p>
            <p>Reflection: I am reserved and process things internally, which allows me to communicate with precision.</p>

            <h2>My Limitations</h2>
            <p>Introversion: The downside of this, is that I can let opportunities pass me by without acting or speaking up. I also tend to avoid activities that require me to be with a large group people unless I already know those people well. Sometimes I come across as impolite as I often turn down invitations to large gatherings.</p>   
            <p>Intuition: I often jump headfirst into projects without fully thinking them through and the result is a half-baked design and understanding of the topic.</p> 
            <p>Thinking: The negative aspect of objective thinking is an added toughness to my personality. Although I can forgive, I find it very difficult to forget and struggle to give people the benefit of the doubt. If someone doesn’t meet my expectations, I often don’t give them a second chance. This can be really unhelpful and I need to recognize that there are many external factors that influence someone’s behavior. I can find it hard to be a team player sometimes.</p>
            <p>Perceiving: I have noticed that my impulsive and spontaneous nature is a main driving force of my life. If I want something or want to do something, I’ll just do it regardless of how difficult it is. I jump headfirst into the deepest end and flail about until I can swim. Sometimes this takes a while, and there are many tears but in the end I am always grateful I took the plunge.</p>

            <h2>Give an example of a time you were trying to work productively with others but were met with resistance.</h2>
            <p>As a musician, I often have to work with others to create music. In the recording studio everyone is working towards one goal – a recorded song. In spite of this, people are often not on the same page as to how to achieve the goal. </p>
            <p>One time, I was called in for a session. Normally, this would consist of me playing the drums for an artist’s recording. This involves communication of the part to be played and recorded from the artist/producer to the session musician (me). This particular session, I was having a hard time interpreting the instructions and although I thought I was playing everything how they had asked me to, they did not see it that way. I was baffled by this, and couldn’t understand how to play what they wanted me to when I wasn’t being told clearly enough what that actually was. </p>
            <p>I took a break, sat down, grabbed a coffee and thought about how I could make the artist happy. The usual methods weren’t working, so I decided to write everything on my computer so I could visually interpret what they wanted. I showed them my mock up and they made changes where necessary. Although unconventional, this was a much better way of communicating and I went back into the booth and nailed the take. </p>
