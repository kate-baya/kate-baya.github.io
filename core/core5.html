            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>  
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I need to re-evaluate my level of confidence. Not that I think I’m over-confident, but I definitely just assume I can jump into a task, quickly get it done and then move onto the next. 
                    It’s important that I take my time to fully understand what is going on before I move on. Rather than letting my ego push me forwards, I need to slow down, enjoy the journey, and take it all in. This is a learning experience, not a race. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    My desire for independence works against me. I require help, a lot. In fact, I struggle through certain tasks and spend a lot more time on them than I should simply because I am either too shy to seek help, or I think I will be a bother if I seek help. 
                    My lack of confidence to reach out and ask for help is a major hinderance in my learning journey and I need to start talking to my peers more. I am stubborn and feel like I can do things on my own if I keep “trying”, but the problem is that this takes too much time and is inefficient.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When I think of myself I am often quite negative towards myself. I’m a tough critic when it comes to my perception of myself. I think I need to give myself a break and not take things so seriously. If I relax more about myself maybe I can be more confident in myself. 
                    This will help me in other areas, such as my introversion.
                </li>
            </ol>
    
            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2> 
            <p>
                For me personally, values, empathy, and self-awareness play an important role in learning and programming. My values, empathy, and self-awareness have acted as “checks” to bring my negative thoughts back in line. 
                I believe that without my values, empathy, and self-awareness I would have given up by now. There have been certain challenges that I have found particularly difficult, and I have been quite hard on myself for not being able to get through them as quickly as some others. 
                When I’m having these negative thoughts, my self-awareness kicks in and I realise that I need to give myself a fighting chance and instead of behaving irrationally, I start to think positively and take steps to combat the problem by either seeking help or even just being empathetic and taking a break.  
            </p>
    
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                I was so surprised at how difficult the core learning has been! I have found all of the learning rather difficult, but I thought the core learning would be a breeze. It’s rather confronting and I have found it a bit of a struggle to be open about my inward thinking.  
            </p>

            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>   
            <p>
                Although I didn’t find it too difficult to pinpoint the aspects of myself that need improving, I have definitely found it challenging to act on these points and actually improve myself. I’m still struggling with reaching out to others for help. I didn’t think it would be so hard from behind a computer screen, but I’m finding it oddly difficult. It’s confronting to know that I’m so terrified of appearing “stupid” that I am placing roadblocks in my learning journey!      
            </p>
    
            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>   
            <p>
                It’s important for graduates to learn how to communicate not only with others, but also ourselves. If we can understand ourselves better we can learn what we need to work on from a personal perspective to make ourselves more approachable. By focusing on core learning we can also learn how we work emotionally as well as intelligently. This is useful in learning how to deal with our stress levels which also helps us remain calm and friendly in high pressure environments such as the ones we will hopefully be working in.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
            <p>
                No, it doesn’t feel like a waste of time, but I do wish I was better at the programming side of things. I feel like I can learn the core stuff relatively easy, although acting on the lessons is tough. When it comes to the practical coding stuff, I find it quite a stretch to actually just learn what I need to do to accomplish a task. I would have liked more time spent on the programming side of things, but from a more hands on approach. I do understand the need for independent learning and the importance of learning HOW to learn, but I have struggled to find the right information to learn the on the programming side of things.       
            </p>
    
            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                I would love to work in web development. Whilst I am not currently sure about the specifics, ideally I would like to work remotely, but also understand that this might not be achievable right off the bat. I plan on finishing up at Dev Academy and will be looking for junior/entry level positions at any location within the country.       
            </p>
    
            <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                My biggest strength will coincidentally also be my biggest limitation, my ability to work independently. My independence will be helpful in that it helps me to remain focused and organized when tackling a task. However, my independence is also a limitation when it comes to tackling difficult tasks. I often fail to reach out when I need guidance, and this can become a real hinderance to my learning. Thinking that I can figure everything out on my own, or being too shy to reach out for help, really limits my ability to learn efficiently.         
            </p>
    
            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>
                Honestly, all of the suggested challenges will be difficult for me - staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, and keeping focused for 9 weeks. The hardest challenge will definitely be speaking in front of the group. I’m ok to speak in front of people when I know what I’m talking about, but in this instance I am learning and I already feel a bit out of my depth. I will need to keep in mind that I am not the only one in this situation. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>
                I am wanting to develop my interpersonal skills. Specifically, I would like to focus on how I communicate technical matters with others within a group setting. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                I will be making sure to manage my workload in this programme by dedicating a set amount of hours during the day to study and attend classes. I will be treating this study as though it is a 9-5 with extra study hours put in where needed. I will be making sure to do some coding at least once a day (including weekends). 
                <br>
                I will need to make sure I reach out for help when needed. I cannot spend more than the allocated time on specific topics of study. If I need more time to understand something, I will need to make sure I am reaching out for guidance. I will make sure to use timeboxing to monitor how much time I am spending on certain tasks. I will first seek help from my cohort and then from my facilitator. 
            </p>
