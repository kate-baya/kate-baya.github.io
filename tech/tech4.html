            <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem</h2>  
            <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
                <p>
                    I got stuck on the deBee kata from Sprint 4. I had to take out the “buzz” words in order to make the sentence readable. 
                </p>
            <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                <p>
                    First off, I used the error messages provided to guide me as far as I could go without having to actually “think” too much. 
                    I just corrected the error messages as simply as I could. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I did some googling in order to learn more about the .filter() method that I needed to use in order to complete this task. 
                    I knew what I needed to do, but wasn’t sure how to filter the right material as I needed to filter all the buzz words regardless of their case
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought I figured it out in a roundabout way, by filtering all the words that were 4 characters long I would catch all of the buzz words without their case being a factor. 
                    I almost solved the problem, but was tripped up by a subtle issue – although my code had taken out all the buzz words, it had also removed some words that I wanted to keep. 
                    I knew this was because my filter was too broad. The problem was that I didn’t know how to narrow it down. So I talked through my problem with my dog, but she didn’t seem to help me any further, as I already knew what the issue was, I just didn’t know HOW to fix it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end it was such a simple fix, and my facilitator, Laché, helped me to figure it out by guiding me to think of a potential solution rather than just handing me the solution. All I needed to do was change the words into lower case then filter the specific word. 
                    I didn’t do this initially because I didn’t fully understand how .filter() worked. 
                </p>
            <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                <p>
                    I was pretty frustrated throughout the process, because I thought I was doing so well, and it was so close to working! I had to move on and try something else while I waited to contact Laché because I was getting too worked up over it. 
                    I actually did some meditation and that helped!
                </p>
            <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
                <p>
                    I learnt how .filter() works, and I also learnt that reaching out for help isn’t giving up, rather it’s a step to move forward and work through a problem. 
                </p>
    
                <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way</h2> 
                <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a tricky one, because honestly I don’t think I’ve solved any problems in an elegant way. 
                        I suppose I managed to solve the concatMyArray problem pretty simply. I just had to turn an array into a string.           
                    </p>
                <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I just used google to look up how .join worked. It was pretty simple, and the error messages helped to guide me in a very concise manner. 
                    </p>
                <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I felt really good. I was flying through this stuff after being stuck with the Super FizzBuzz challenge, so I was feeling pretty good!
                    </p>
                <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aside from learning about .join(), I don’t feel like I learnt a whole lot during this challenge. I did learn that in relation to other tasks, this one was easy for me to do. 
                        So some challenges will be easier than others and I shouldn’t get too bogged down when a challenge comes my way. 
                    </p>
        
                    <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h2>
                    <h3>Pseudocode</h3> 
                        <p>
                            Pseudocode is very helpful, but I sometimes think I might be using this technique wrong as I don’t feel like I know enough to write the code in a logical way to achieve what I want.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Trying something</h3> 
                        <p>
                            I’m pretty confident in this problem solving technique as I just send it and try something. Most of the time it doesn’t work, but there’s been a lot of instances where I’ve been pleasantly surprised!
                        </p>
                        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3> 
                        <p>
                            I love this method so much. It’s very helpful to talk through a problem out loud and explain what you need to do and where you think you’ve gone wrong. Vocalizing the issue somehow changes the way I think and breaks down the problem in a different way. It’s more helpful having someone to bounce ideas back and forth with, though.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Reading error messages</h3> 
                        <p>
                            For the most part, this is a great way to solve problems. When the message is clear it helps me know where to start. When the message isn’t so clear, I can become confused and end up going down a road that is completely unrelated to the issue.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Console.logging </h3> 
                        <p>
                            Console.logging is amazing. Being able to see what the computer is reading and doing is super helpful in figuring out what I need change in order to make things work. I use console.logging all the time and find it very helpful.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Googling</h3> 
                        <p>
                            While using Google to look up solutions to problems or figure out how to use certain methods is helpful, it can also be quite dangerous. If I’m unsure about what it is that I’m looking up or need to know, I can end up learning about something unrelated or perhaps the information is just “wrong”. There is a lot of material out there and not all of it is helpful. Learning to discern between what I need to know and what I don’t need to know is quite tricky.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3> 
                        <p>
                            I’m not all that confident asking my peers for help. This is something I definitely need to work on. So far I have just been reading what everyone else is having trouble with. For the most part I have the same issues and benefit from reading their discussions. However, there have been moments where I could have learnt a lot by just reaching out.
                        </p>  
                        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3> 
                        <p>
                            This is another method that I’m not all that confident in doing. I’m getting better though, as I realise how beneficial this is to my learning. Being guided into potential solutions and ways of problem solving has been invaluable as it shows me how I should be thinking. This is helpful for my Googling, pseudocode, and rubber ducky methods too because it gets me asking the right questions. 
                        </p> 
                        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3> 
                        <p>
                            Reflection is a great tool for learning. By reflecting on my problems and solutions I’m able to recognize patterns in my way of working. It’s not easy to see at the time, but with more reflection I’ll be able to notice these patterns and correct any unhelpful work habits I have. I have noticed that its often the same kind of problems that I find difficult, so I am able to look back and think of the solutions that I found to those kinds of problems and apply them to the ones I am currently facing.
                        </p>
